                <h1>Postpartum Depression</h1>
                <h3>1 in 7 women experience depression within the first six months after delivery.</h3>
                <p class="lead">There is no known single cause of postpartum depression. Postpartum depression (PPD) is a severe, intense, 
                    and long-lasting form of “baby blues” that arises after the birth of a child. 
                    "Baby blues" tends to resolve within two weeks after delivery. 
                    There are physical and emotional factors that may predispose one to experience depression 
                    after welcoming a child. 
                    <br>
                    Some risk factors for postpartum depression include the age of the mother at the time of pregnancy, 
                    history of depression or bipolar disorder prior or during pregnancy, birth complications from a previous pregnancy, 
                    the number of children before the index pregnancy, hormonal changes due to pregnancy, 
                    history of Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder (PMDD), loneliness, lack of social support, and/or marital conflict.
