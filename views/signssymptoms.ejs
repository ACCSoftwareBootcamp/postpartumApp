<h3>Postpartum Depression</h3>
<p>1 in 7 women experience depression within the first six months after delivery.</p>

<article>
    There is no known single cause of postpartum depression. Postpartum depression (PPD) is a severe, intense, 
    and long-lasting form of “baby blues” that arises after the birth of a child. 
    "Baby blues" tends to resolve within two weeks after delivery. 
    <br>
    There are physical and emotional factors that may predispose one to experience depression 
    after welcoming a child. 
    <br>
    Some risk factors for postpartum depression include the age of the mother at the time of pregnancy, 
    history of depression or bipolar disorder prior or during pregnancy, birth complications from a previous pregnancy, 
    the number of children before the index pregnancy, hormonal changes due to pregnancy, 
    history of Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder (PMDD), loneliness, lack of social support, and/or marital conflict.

<h3>Postpartum Anxiety</h3>

<section>
    <p>Though postpartum anxiety and postpartum depression are not the same, 
    some estimates claim between 25-50% of people with anxiety disorders also develop postpartum depression in the 2 months following childbirth.
    Postpartum anxiety, or excessive anxiety that develops after childbirth, is less known or researched
    but people with postpartum anxiety experience thoughts that can be:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>uncontrollable</li>
        <li>racing</li>

        <li>irrational (not logical or realistic)</li>
        <li>frightening</li>
    </ul>
        
    <p>These uncontrollable, consuming thoughts tend to center on a few major areas of worry, such as:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>fears about the baby's and one's own health</li>
        <li>fears about a parent or partner becoming ill or dying</li>
        <li>a sense that something bad will happen</li>
        <li>irrational obsessions or fears</li>
        <li>blaming oneself excessively when something goes wrong or feeling excessively guilty</li>
    </ul>
