<article>
    There is no known single cause of postpartum depression. Postpartum depression (PPD) is a severe, intense, 
    and long-lasting form of “baby blues” that arises after the birth of a child. 
    "Baby blues" tends to resolve within two weeks after delivery. 
    <br>
    There are physical and emotional factors that may predispose one to experience depression 
    after welcoming a child. 
    <br>
    Some risk factors for postpartum depression include the age of the mother at the time of pregnancy, 
    history of depression or bipolar disorder prior or during pregnancy, birth complications from a previous pregnancy, 
    the number of children before the index pregnancy, hormonal changes due to pregnancy, 
    history of Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder (PMDD), loneliness, lack of social support, and/or marital conflict.
