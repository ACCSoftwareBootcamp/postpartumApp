           <h1>About Us</h1>
           <p class="lead">This app was developed during ACC Software Development Bootcamp as a capstone project. 
            Our team felt strongly that a private resource for postpartum women was necessary in our world. So many
            apps have an emphasis on social media that has a proven negative impact on mental health. We wanted to 
            create a safe space where women can have retrieve personalized resources for postpartum support, all 
            confidential and free.</p>
